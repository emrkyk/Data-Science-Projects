# Data-Science-Projects

Hello and Welcome!

I've been publishing the remarkable DS projects I have recently completed.

While conducting DS projects, I'm keen on researching the holistic part of the Data Science - Analytics projects with an understanding that touches the practices in the sector with a brief literature review.
Some of the projects consist of only codes, for now, but presentations also will be added as they are constantly updated over time.

Projects will range from CRM, RFM, CLTV, ARL, Dynamic Pricing, AB Testing, Sorting, Scoring, Feature Engineering Applications, Supervised/ Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms, Recommendation Systems, Big Data, NLP, SQL in RFM and to some remarkable ones. 
Greetings!
